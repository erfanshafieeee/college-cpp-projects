## Introduction

This repository showcases a variety of C++ programs that explore different programming paradigms such as loops, conditional statements, data structures, and object-oriented programming. The programs cover areas from basic algorithms to more complex problem-solving techniques.

## Project Overview

### Factorial Series Calculation

- **Files**: `donbale1.cpp`, `donbale2.cpp`
- **Description**: These programs calculate the sum of a factorial series based on user input for two variables. The series formula is handled differently in each file to demonstrate two approaches: one involving loops and conditionals and the other using functions like factorial and power.

### Library Management System

- **Files**: `library.cpp`, `library_oop.cpp`
- **Description**: A simple library management system where users can add, search, lend, return, and sort books. The program has been implemented both using traditional C++ structures and object-oriented style.

### Positive and Negative Number Separation

- **Files**: `mosbatomanfi.cpp`
- **Description**: This program takes user input for a series of numbers and separates them into positive and negative categories, printing both sets of numbers.

### Symmetric Number Checker

- **Files**: `motegharen1.cpp`, `motegharen2.cpp`
- **Description**: These programs check if a user-input number is symmetric (a palindrome). The first version uses a helper function, while the second version does it inline.

### Prime Number Finder

- **Files**: `aval1-1000.cpp`
- **Description**: This program finds all the prime numbers between 1 and 1000, using a simple loop to check divisibility.

### Storage Management

- **Files**: `storage.cpp`, `storage-oop.cpp`
- **Description**: A storage management system that allows users to add, delete, and search for goods in a storage facility. It tracks goods, their amounts, and prices.

### Student Grading System

- **Files**: `student.cpp`, `student_oop.cpp`
- **Description**: This program records studentsâ€™ grades, calculates averages, and determines those who excel and those on probation based on their grades.

### University Library Management

- **Files**: `university_libraries.cpp`
- **Description**: A library management system for a university. Users can add, delete, search, borrow, and return books in both central and college-specific libraries.

### Personnel Management

- **Files**: `personel.cpp`
- **Description**: This program records information about personnel, including their names, personal codes, salaries, and children. It also identifies personnel with low salaries and more than two children.

### Text Manipulation Tool

- **Files**: `projecttotal.cpp`
- **Description**: A program that allows users to add, remove, and search words in a collection of strings, simulating simple text manipulation.

### Shop Management System

- **Files**: `shop.cpp`
- **Description**: A shop management system where users can insert, delete, search for goods, and process sales and returns. It also manages a factor system to track sales.
